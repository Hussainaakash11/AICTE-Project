# AI-powered Resume Screening and Ranking System

## Overview
This project aims to automate resume screening and candidate ranking using AI, improving hiring efficiency and reducing bias. The system leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) to analyze resumes, match them with job descriptions, and generate ranked candidate lists.

## Features
- **Automated Resume Screening**: Extracts key information using NLP.
- **Candidate Ranking**: Uses ML algorithms to score and rank candidates.
- **Bias Mitigation**: Ensures fairness in candidate evaluation.
- **Job Matching**: Matches resumes to job descriptions based on relevance.
- **Recruitment Insights**: Provides data-driven hiring analytics.

## System Design
1. **User Input**: Resume uploads (PDF/DOC) and job descriptions.
2. **Preprocessing & Feature Extraction**: NLP techniques extract key details.
3. **Resume Matching & Ranking**: ML model scores and ranks candidates.
4. **Bias Mitigation**: Ensures fair candidate evaluation.
5. **Output & Insights**: Generates ranked lists and hiring analytics.
